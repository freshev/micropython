Sometimes I download a chm file, but when I open it it is blank and no content is displayed. So what should I do if the chm file is opened and there is no content? I will share the solution below for your reference.

When the chm file is opened and is blank and has no content, the display is as follows:

If this is a very formal text and the download is not damaged or anything like that. First close the file, right-click the file and select Properties-View.

You can see a prompt in General that this document comes from another computer and may be blocked to help protect your computer.

If you trust this document, click Unlock. If you feel it is unsafe, then give up. After it is released, it will be displayed as follows:

At this time, reopen the document and test it until it can be opened normally and the content inside is displayed normally.

If you still can't open it by this method, check whether the file is damaged or blocked by anti-virus software.
